# Car-Pool-Game
This is a pool game played on a billiards table in which you use cars to strike all striped balls into the pockets around the edge of the table before the computer strikes all the solid balls. You have to use the arrow keys to drive the car and use the spacebar to boost. Avoid hitting the 8 Ball or your car will be disabled for 8 seconds.
